# PiCCANTE 🌶️

**Pi**CCANTE **C**ar **C**ontroller **A**rea **N**etwork **T**ool for **E**xploration

PiCCANTE is a powerful hacking tool for accessing, exploring, and manipulating vehicle CAN bus networks, built on the affordable Raspberry Pi Pico platform. Designed for researchers, security professionals, and automotive enthusiasts looking to dive deep into vehicle systems without expensive proprietary equipment.

⚠️ **Always exercise caution when connecting to vehicle systems.** ⚠️ 

## ℹ️ About PiCCANTE

PiCCANTE is designed to be a dead-**simple**, dirt-**cheap**, and readily-**available** hardware platform for vehicle research and exploration.  
As cars become more and more computerized, manufacturers keep locking them behind proprietary tools and restrictive systems, even connect vehicles to the internet, yet they still rely on communication standards from the 1980s.  
Car hacking and independent research grows increasingly important to discover security vulnerabilities, reverse engineer vehicle systems, and empower owners with custom tools for diagnostics and tuning that support the Right to Repair movement.

The project leverages Raspberry Pi Pico (2 [W]) development boards, selected for their exceptional affordability, global availability, impressive specifications, and well-documented open-source SDK.

## 🔧 Hardware

For more information, checkout the [hardware](./hardware) directory.

### Simplest version

PiCCANTE is designed to be modular and can be built with just a few components.  
The simplest version just uses a Pico board and a CAN transceiver.

### 🛒 What You'll Need

- 1× Raspberry Pi Pico (any model, RP2040 or RP2350)
  - **Note:** The Pico 2 W (RP2350) is recommended for full feature support, including WiFi and Bluetooth.
- 1-3× CAN transceivers (readily available SN65HVD or any other 3.3V compatible transceiver)
  - **Note:** ⚠️ Most readily available transceiver breakout-boards have a 120 Ohm terminating Resistor on them, when connecting to an existing (terminated) CAN bus this **needs** to be removed. ⚠️
- USB cable

If you want more features, you can add an SD card slot, a buck converter, and other things.

### OBD-II Dongle (DIY Perfboard)

A full PiCCANTE based OBD-II dongle is simple enough to be soldered onto double-sided perfboard.

<details>
  <summary>Show Details</summary>
<br />

A perfboard version fits on a 60mm x 50mm board and the 3D printable case measures just 97mm x 56mm including the OBD-II connector.

It cam be built with the following components (but you can omit anything you don't need):

- Pi Pico (2 [W])
- 3x CAN transceivers (eg. SN65HVD, any 3.3V compatible transceiver will do)
- buck-converter
- SD card slot
- Voltage divider for measuring the vehicle's battery voltage
- Schottky diode for safe dual power supply (1N5817)
- **Case**:
  - ABS/ASA or PETG filament
  - 3x M3 screws
  - 3x M3 heatset inserts
  - 1x male OBD-II connector (I used [this one](https://store.minitools.com/en/components-and-connectors/obd-connectors/sep-a-obd-e2-obd2-male-connector.html))
  - Wires

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 🔄 Why only CAN2.0B and not CAN FD/XL?

The Raspberry Pi Pico has no native CAN support. The PIO can2040 implementation we're using only supports CAN 2.0B (due to licensing issues).  
However, if you **need** CAN FD or other bus types, feel free to open a PR supporting a CAN controller (like MCP2518FD).  

### 🔌 Can I use PiCCANTE with Linux/Windows/macOS?

Yes! PiCCANTE is designed to be cross-platform. It works with any operating system as a standard USB device with no special drivers required.  
For SLCAN interfaces, Linux users can use can-utils to provide a SocketCAN interface, while all platforms support the GVRET/SLCAN interface through tools like SavvyCAN.

### 💻 How many CAN buses can I monitor simultaneously?

Up to 3 CAN buses on the RP2350 (Pico 2/2W) and up to 2 CAN buses on the RP2040 (original Pico/Pico W).  
Each bus has a dedicated USB-CDC SLCAN interface.

### 🔧 Why build my own instead of buying a commercial CAN adapter?

PiCCANTE gives you a fully open-source solution at a fraction of the cost of commercial tools.  
You get complete control over the hardware and software, the ability to customize for specific needs, and valuable learning experience about CAN networks and embedded systems.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: CAN bus not receiving data  
  *Solutions*:  
  - Verify CAN status with `can_status` command
  - Verify wiring and bitrate settings
  - Check for proper bus termination resistance (remove resistor on the transceiver if connected to an existing CAN-bus)

- **Issue**: LED not lighting up / blinking  
  *Solutions*:
  - Check USB connection and power
  - Check led_mode command on the first USB CDC device
